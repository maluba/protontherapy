This is a git repo for improved Geant4 proton therapy app (after MSc.)

To be done in this app:
1). use the voxelized cylindrical complex geometry to tally dose
2). dose deposited sorted according to pp, sp, & rc (particle groups)
3). dose by pp that undergo nuclear elastic scattering tallied into sp
4). produce depth and lateral histograms of dose by each particle category + dose in tuple filesystem
